# PirnatEco
Towards Sustainable Deep Learning for Wireless Fingerprinting Localization

### [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9838464) | dkjfn

Model PirnatEco can be found in PirnatEco.ipynb. The whole code needed to run the model, link to the dataset CTW2019 and the model is in the WholeCode.ipynb.

There is also a code for a webapp that calculates complexity of the DL model with equations used and presented in the paper.

### Citation

If you are using our model, citation of [Towards Sustainable Deep Learning for Wireless Fingerprinting Localization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9838464) would be greatly appreciated.
If you are using the support code in WholeCode, citation of [Improving CSI-based Massive MIMO Indoor Positioning using Convolutional Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03130) would be greatly appreciated.
