## Google Colab
If you wish to experiment with the model or try out the code, we have written a code in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/anzepirnat/PirnatEco/blob/main/WholeCode.ipynb). 

You can find the PirnatEco model in PirnatEco.ipynb. To access the complete code required to run the model, along with the CTW2019 dataset and the model itself, refer to WholeCode.ipynb. You can deploy the whole code using the Colab link located above the text.

Additionally, we have developed a web application that calculates the complexity of the DL model using the equations presented in the paper.

## Getting started
To replicate the experiment, start by downloading the data from the [original source](https://data.ieeemlc.org/Ds1Detail) in the .hdf5 format. After that, save the downloaded data to your Google Drive with the following path: MyDrive/CTW2019_h5/. Once saved, click on the "Open in Colab" button and run the code as desired. If you have any questions, we are happy to provide answers.


### Requirements
The last cell of WholeCode.ipynb displays the requirements needed for running the code. Additionally, a requirements.txt file is also provided which includes all the dependencies installed by Colab, including those not used in the code.
