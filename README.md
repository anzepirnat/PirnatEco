Model PirnatEco can be found in PirnatEco.ipynb. The whole code needed to run the model, link to the dataset CTW2019 and the model is in the WholeCode.ipynb.

There is also a code for a webapp that calculates complexity of the DL model with equations used and presented in the paper.

### Citation

If you are using our model, citation of [Towards Sustainable Deep Learning for Wireless Fingerprinting Localization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9838464) would be greatly appreciated.
If you are using the support code in WholeCode, citation of [Improving CSI-based Massive MIMO Indoor Positioning using Convolutional Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03130) would be greatly appreciated.
